# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders

A simple and effective anomaly-detection model for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
The Autoencoder learns patterns of normal transactions and flags unusual behavior using reconstruction error.

## What This Project Does

Learns only from normal transactions (unsupervised learning)

Detects fraud using reconstruction error thresholding

Handles highly imbalanced datasets

Includes visualizations such as error plots, confusion matrix, and PR curve

## Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results

The Autoencoder successfully identifies most fraudulent transactions, showing strong anomaly-detection performance with high recall.
